          LAPPIS is a Brazilian Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) lab dedicated 
          to promoting collaboration and engagement within free and open-source communities. Located in the University of Brasilia (UnB)
          Led by women, the lab's mission is to increase the number of young South Americans, 
          women and underrepresented groups in contribute to high-impact open-source projects,
           overcoming barriers such as language, impostor syndrome, and inclusion.

           We do this through collaboration with both government and private sector in developing
            open source projects. We had more than 100 students with scholarship contributing to OSS 
            in Brazilian context. These projects provide opportunities for networking, sharing knowledge, 
            and fostering collaboration among enthusiasts and professionals engage in advocacy efforts 
            to promote the adoption and use of open-source software. LAPPIS also engage in discussions 
            advocating for open standards, participating in policy discussions and development, and 
            raising awareness about the benefits of open-source development and adoption, while fomenting 
            local industry.
