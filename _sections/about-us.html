         We do this through collaboration with both government and private sector in developing
          open source projects. We had more than 100 students with scholarship contributing to OSS 
          in Brazilian context. These projects provide opportunities for networking, sharing knowledge, 
          and fostering collaboration among enthusiasts and professionals engage in advocacy efforts 
          to promote the adoption and use of open-source software. LAPPIS also engage in discussions 
          advocating for open standards, participating in policy discussions and development, and 
          raising awareness about the benefits of open-source development and adoption, while fomenting
