Project to generate recommendations in the evaluation and submission of cultural projects in SALIC. The objective is to apply machine learning techniques to extract patterns from the historical data of previously submitted cultural projects (approximately 30,000 projects), and to use these patterns to recommend anomalies, areas for improvement in cultural projects, and to generate metrics of complexity and quality for such projects. We work on a microservices architecture to bring innovation to legacy systems (such as SALIC).
