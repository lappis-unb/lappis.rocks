The Brazil Participatory Platform is the largest social participation platform of the federal government of Brazil, with over 1.5 million users in 3 months. It is built to allow the population to contribute to the creation and improvement of public policies. The platform was developed using open-source software with the support of Dataprev, the Decidim-Brasil community, the Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services (MGI), and LAPPIS.

The OSS Brasil Participativo platform customizes participatory processes from the Decidim framework to suit the Brazilian context. Presently, the Decidim Brasil community boasts over 200 participants, while the OSS Brasil Participativo has garnered the involvement of over 100 direct and indirect contributors in its first year alone. Brazil stands out as one of the primary adopters of this tool on a national level, given its compelling features, adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and steadfast commitment to transparent participatory processes.
