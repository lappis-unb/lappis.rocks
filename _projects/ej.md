The EJ (Empurrando Juntas) is an opinion collection platform that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to group participants based on their opinions. The grouping is done through personas, which allows for the discovery of new nuances and groups that would not be identifiable otherwise. With the results of a collection, EJ enables understanding of what the target audience thinks about a particular topic, thus strengthening its communication strategy.
