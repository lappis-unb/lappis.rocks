The BOSS initiative aims to reach underrepresented groups in tech who want to be mentored and assisted to learn how to work on open source projects. We will provide a safe space and an accompanying methodology for them to learn basic concepts of working in a small open source project in practice and build enough background for them to, at the end of the program, be able to choose other projects to continue their contributions. The mentoring process helps build confidence, fill in technical gaps, and engage the participants. 

In the BOSS program, besides the technical aspects of introducing newcomers to open source, we deal with some challenges to inclusion, namely, intersectionality and impostor syndrome.
