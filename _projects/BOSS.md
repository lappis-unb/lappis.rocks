The BOSS initiative aims to support underrepresented groups in the tech industry who seek mentorship and guidance to learn how to contribute to open-source projects. We are proud to have been awarded first place in the [Gnome Community Challenge](https://www.gnome.org/challenge/winners/).

Our program offers a safe and supportive environment along with a structured methodology to help participants grasp the fundamental concepts of collaborating on open-source projects. By the program's end, participants will have acquired the necessary skills to continue their contributions to other projects confidently. Our mentoring approach not only addresses technical knowledge gaps but also fosters confidence and engagement among participants. In addition to technical training, the BOSS program addresses inclusion challenges such as intersectionality and impostor syndrome.
