The DermaCam project aims to implement an innovative strategy through a skin lesion screening optimization system, integrating records and data into an analytical platform following the Data Fabric model for the early diagnosis of skin cancer in Primary Health Care (PHC). This approach is combined with the application of a clinical screening questionnaire, the capture and recording of suspicious images using a dermatoscope, and the integration of the historical series of registered medical visits with ICD codes related to the disease.
