The project aims to establish a monitoring system for both the supply and consumption of electricity throughout the University of Brasília (UnB). Additionally, a recommendation system will be implemented to suggest the most suitable contracts for major consumers. This initiative forms part of a broader investment by the University of Brasilia aimed at positioning it as the fourth most sustainable university in Brazil.

Measurement equipment has been strategically installed at various locations within the university to gather diverse indicators pertaining to the quality and availability of electricity. Subsequently, this data will be transmitted across the network to a centralized system responsible for storage and accessibility, serving purposes such as research or ongoing monitoring.

The LAPPIS team leads the the development this open source project of a distributed system tasked with data collection from the meters, its centralization, and delivery to an application designed for user-friendly visualization of information. This visualization will encompass the use of reports, graphs, and comparative analyses, thereby enhancing comprehension and facilitating data interpretation.
