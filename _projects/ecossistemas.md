The "Free Software Ecosystems" project is a partnership between LAPPIS and the Ministry of Culture (MinC), initiated in October 2017 with a planned duration of 24 months. The partnership aims to bring innovation to the open-source software systems developed by the Ministry and to conduct applied research in continuous delivery, DevOps, and machine learning techniques.

One of the research endeavors related to this project led to the publication of ["A survey of DevOps concepts and challenges"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3359981), an article with over 450 citations.
