In this project, we experiment with several machine learning algorithms to detect outliers and anomalies in large Customer Dataset. We deploy Data, Feature Engineering, and MLOps techniques and practices. 

We adopted a commonly used machine learning workflow depicted in various forms across industry and research. It has commonalities with prior workflows defined in data science and data mining, such as TDSP, KDD, and CRISP-DM. They have in common the data-centered essence of the process and the multiple feedback loops among the different stages. We followed some DevOps and MLOps best practices and automation to speed up the experimentation cycle and scale the process to other databases and a larger team.
