The project, developed in collaboration between the Laboratory of Free Software Competence (Lab Livre) at the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB) and the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), focuses on improving the management and integration of structural government data systems in Brazil. These systems, essential for public administration, store critical information on budgeting, personnel, and organizational structures. However, data redundancy, inconsistencies, and interoperability barriers have hindered evidence-based decision-making and transparency. To address these issues, the project developed a technological solution that integrates and qualifies data, ensuring better access, reliability, and usability for public managers and society.
Using open-source technologies and automation, the initiative enables the efficient extraction, transformation, and visualization of government data. The project streamlines administrative processes and strengthens public accountability by structuring workflows and enhancing data interoperability. Adopting open technologies reduces dependency on proprietary software, fostering innovation and adaptability across different government entities. With a replicable and scalable approach, the project enhances data-driven governance and promotes a culture of transparency and informed decision-making within the Brazilian public sector.
